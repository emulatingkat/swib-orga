Call for Proposals: SWIB22 online conference - 14th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference
28 November - 02 December 2022, UTC 14:00-16:30
Submission Deadline: 28 June

SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held
for the 14th time.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot be sure that by November travelling
and meeting face-to-face will be possible for everybody in the community.
Therefore, we have decided to hold SWIB22 the second time on the web.
This will offer everybody an opportunity to easily participate from all over the world.

Taking into account the different time zones of the participants, we plan to carry
out the conference during the week of 28 November - 02 December, daily from 
UTC 14:00 to 16:30.

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations.
It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and
researchers from all over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other. The
topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking data
and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas of
focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied
sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB22 will be organized by ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre for Economics
and the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz). The conference language
is English.

Would you like to share your experiences working on an interesting service,
research topic or project – not just what you did, but also how you did it?

For this SWIB rendition we adjusted the formats to the online environment:

- Presentations (15 minutes plus 5 q&a) [???], pre-recorded talks are encouraged
- Practical workshops or tutorials (maximum 150 min, including breaks),
